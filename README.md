# Tables_Builder_Lite

## Info about project ##
This is my first (not so fully) completed database-related project. I used PostreSQL database managment system, 
and Heroku platform to store my database in the cloud. 
Also, this is the first time when I used Kivy framework to develop application.

## What is this application? ##
It's very basic GUI which allows user to:
* create new tables in database (with two available data types of column)
  * integer
  * text
![My Image](images/img1.jpg)
* add new rows to existing tables
* look through table's records
* delete existing tables from database

As I mentioned, It's not completed project and there is a lot of features which hopefully I will add in the not too-distant-future.
